// Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it ~{Dynamic Programming}

// Two Ways to Solve : 1. Tabulation Method : Bottom Up DP
//                     2. Memoization Method : Top Down DP

// Overlapping Subproblems : solved a subproblem S1 and we again encounter the same problem further that is called as Overlapping Subproblems

// Memoization : tend to store the value of sub problems in some map/table
// Tabulation : Similar to Memoization , we just start from base upto our answer

// How to identify DP Problem? Maximize/Minimize + Count number of ways

// Recurrence Relation Shortcut
// 1. try to represent the problem in terms of index
// 2. do all possible stuff on that index according to question
// 3. Sum all stuff -> count total ways , min(all stuff) -> find mini , max(all stuff) -> find maxi

// Rules : if there is an ind-1,ind-2 there will be always be an space optimization

/* Dp Problems
1. Fibonacci Sequence
2. Climbing Stairs
3. Frog Jumps
4. Frog Jumps with K distances
5. Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements
